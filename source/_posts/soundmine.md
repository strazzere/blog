![SoundMine by CrapApps](http://173.230.150.16/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/mine_dark.png "SoundMine")
What the heck is the big deal about this application? Why would people even pay for this anyway? Undoubtable the best comment is:

All it does is reference the Android built in Tone Generator? [android.media.ToneGenerator](http://code.google.com/android/reference/android/media/ToneGenerator.html)

Shesh - atleast make like a bluebox or something! Actually wait... That's a good idea - let me put that on my to-do list!
