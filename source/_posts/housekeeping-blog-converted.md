It only took a countless amount of years along with a pandemic, apparently, in order to get me in gear and clean up the blog. This has been on a forever long "todo" list, which never really had any likelyhood of getting addresses. Though, after paying the Rackspace bill for my ancient, extremely grandfathered, $5 vps, I figued - why not? Let's convert all this stuff over to markdown and be done with it.

Well, here it is - in somehow, an uglier form than it was before. Oh well, it's free, it's on github and now that it _isn't_ wordpress, maybe I'll write some more things.
