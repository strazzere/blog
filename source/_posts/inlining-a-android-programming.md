Been doing some experimentation with some extremely interesting results. Looks like inlining a program is possible, though it does get a little messy... I've been doing mostly everything by hand and guessing - but it looks like I might be able to write up a program to do it for me. I don't have a whole lot of time right now as I'm time crunched with some exams, so I can't do into explicit detail, though if you understand the DEX file system and the Android OS it's rather similar to injecting in to normal java vm's. This process is well described [here](http://xantorohara.blogspot.com/2007/09/java-code-injection-via-winapis.html).

Hopefully I'll have some time later to post to tests and results of what I've been doing and how it's being done.
