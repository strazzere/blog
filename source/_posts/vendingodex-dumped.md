Well it's really late right now, and I've been working on a ton of thing, though I thought I'd release this.

This is a decompile version of Vending.odex (Vending.apk/Market.apk) for the G1. It was done using a slightly modified DeDexer by Gabor, mentioned in previous posts.

Enjoy -- I'll post more on it later!
