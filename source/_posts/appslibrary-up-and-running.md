![A Cheesy Alternative](http://173.230.150.16/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/applibrary-300x164.png "A Cheesy Alternative")
So it's not the best thing in the world -- but it's functional... That's more than I can say for the versions of AppsLib I've been able to install on my device :) I'd first like to thank Justin of nEx.Software for throwing together a design for me, since I'm horrible at html!

Anyway - I plan to add more features, such as searching, sorting methods (category, hosted by, approved) though they aren't fully tested and I haven't had the time to do that yet. I'll also try to have a statistics page up, with who is hosting the most applications, app ranking, apps approved, etc. As of right now AppsLibrary (A Cheesy Alternative) will show you a listing of all applications, ten on each page sorted by the most updated/submitted application.

It will also show on the detailed page app name, developer, release notes, description, downloads (if available), version, date of last update, package name, category, if it is hosted by archos, if it is approved by archos and a download link to it.

Note that since some of the files are _not_ hosted by archos there is no way to gadge their downloads. These links also might become dead as those hosts figure out AppsLib has been hotlinking them all this time too. So remember, this data is what AppsLib has -- not something I've created myself, so please don't request for me to "add more apps" :)

Feel free to post to me on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/timstrazz) or on this page with requests of features, etc.
