With the (hopefully) eminent release of the cupcake update for the android os â€“ this is supposed to be fixed with the addition of `Settings.Secure`; though I guess we wonâ€™t know until it gets released?

Anyway â€” basically you can modify system values in a specific database, so any program that calls Settings.`System.Android_ID` can be given any id of your choosing.

Just load up adb and navigate to the sqlite database: `/data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases/settings.db`

Run the query;
```
select * from system;
```
Youâ€™ll see plenty of information which can then be changed. Running the following;
```
update system set value=â€™dead00beefâ€™ where name=â€™android_idâ€™;
```
Would give you an ultra-slick `android_id` of `dead00beef` ðŸ™‚

Note that this will NOT change the android id used by google products since they use one that is linked to your gmail account that the phone is associated with...
