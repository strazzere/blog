![No... Not yet - and probably not for a while...](http://173.230.150.16/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/g1-virus-300x251.jpg "G1-Virus?")
Wait, what? There hasn't even been a virus or malicious file (publicly) released yet, and someone has already started selling anti-virus for the Android OS?! I had to see this one for myself...

_...SMobile's of security engineers immediately went to work to create security solution designed specifically for the platform. SMobile Systems has announced its standard security offering, called SecurityShield(tm) -- an integrated application that includes anti-virus, anti-spam and firewall protection-- is up and running on the Android operating system._

_"We believe that the launch of Android powered phones will usher in a period when the use of smartphones will skyrocket," said Rick Roscitt, chairman and chief executive officer, SMobile Systems. "As more consumers in the U.S. begin using their mobile devices as mini-computers for surfing the web and downloading third-party applications, mobile security becomes of paramount importance. Without security, millions of people could be at risk for hackers, spammers and others intent on stealing crucial personal, financial and even health information from their new Google-powered phones."_

_The company plans on adapting the remainder of their applications to the Android platform in the coming weeks and months. Additionally, SMobile plans on creating new security products specifically tailored to Android, including an advanced application level firewall and system monitor. Currently, the Android platform does not allow the user to decide whether an application can make phones calls, send text or multi-media messages or make connections to the Internet during normal device use. This means that a virus can pose as an application and do things like dial phone numbers, send text messages and other functions that can cost the user money and leave their highly personal information vulnerable. The new technologies under development at SMobile will protect users against these new threats._

_"SMobile believes that the Linux-based operating system will quickly enable hackers to explore and eventually exploit any security holes in the core Google software as well as third party software, allowing phishers, spammers, and others to look for ways to target user's information for ill intent," said George Tuvell, chief technology officer, SMobile Systems. "We have years of experience porting our applications into new mobile operating systems and developing the best mobile security products on the market. As leaders in this industry it is our responsibility to rapidly meet new market demands and respond to new market threats."_

Wow, sound great doesn't it? Yea with a virus definition file like the following - why _wouldn't_ you want to buy it?

Looks great doesn't it? Twenty-five viruses, wait no, twenty-three viruses and two dummy files can be detected. That's a great service I'd love to pay money for. Now - I'm _sure_ they are going to expand they're database to include more files but serious, they are charging for this already?! Not only do they have a weak definition file, but if you bother to google any of the names, they are all Symbian viruses. So unless your using your Android phone to download and store files for you Symbian phone, why would you _need_ this application?

I took a deep look into their files... The code looks pretty solid, it does what it should and what it is allowed too. The problem is, that even _if_ a virus came onto the AndroidOS system - this scanner will most likely _never_ find it. This program is not given above average access to the system, meaning it can only see what other applications see. So mostly files that do not matter this program can scan, if a virus where to use an exploit and gain high privileges then this program would be useless even if it did have good heuristics or definitions. It's a nice try guys, and you look like you have one of the best registration schemes yet, but I really don't think $9.99 for a license is worth it. Also note that the sales pitch claims to protect you from over "400 instances and varients of mobile malware" - what a crock of lies that is... Sounds to me like SMobile has been looking to produce some scare-ware and took notes from FSecure or McAfee.

_SMobile VirusGuard for Android is the first antivirus application available to protect Google's revolutionary new mobile device operating system. VirusGuard provides users with protection against over 400 instances and variants of mobile malware. These viruses, worms and trojans can infect and cross-over between mobile devices via the memory card, web-browser and by the installation of open source applications._
