![Mmmmm... Market Data...](http://173.230.150.16/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/android_market_combo_8282008_wide_600x297-300x148.png "Mmmmm... Market Data...")
Success! After many, many man hours - finally it's been completed. Strangely enough, it's actually much simpler that I ever thought it would be. Sort of makes me feel silly for not thinking about the _easy_ solutions first. Though, that wouldn't be fun if we always did the easy steps before the grunt work...

Anyway, my friend Andrea of at [Androidiani.com](http://www.androidiani.com/) and I have been trying to do some research into purchasing of applications on the market. Since Andrea is in Italy, he can't purchase apps, so we've been trying to resolve this for him!

To wet your lips, we've figured out a way to make it work and Andrea has wiped up a program to easy the process. Below is a quick image to show it off :)

Here is a quick screen shot of his Italian G1 looking at paid apps (you'll have to take our word on this for now)

Andrea plans to release this application tomorrow on his site, [Androidiani.com](http://www.androidiani.com/). After his posting, I will be posting an english version here, with the source and hopefully around the same time a paper explaining what we did, how we did it and how the program actually works.

_Until then, ciao!_
